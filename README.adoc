== React Redux Basic Tutorial

https://redux.js.org/[recommended Redux patterns]

=== Components

* `TodoApp` container component rendering below:
  ** `AddTodo` user form to enter/add item
  ** `TodoList` renders list of todos
  ** `Todo` renders single item
  ** `VisibilityFilters` filter links: accepts `activeFilter` prop; dispatches `setFilter` actions
* `constants` enum of filters
* `index` renders app to the DOM
* Redux https://redux.js.org/
  ** *Store* the state
  ** *Action Creators* components create actions affecting common state
  ** *Reducers* ???
  ** *Action Types* `actionTypes.js` to hold reusable constants of action types
  ** *Selectors* gets data from store



=== Notes

* React hypes the "virtual dom" as the reason react is so fast
* Components "look like" HTML templates (actually JSX)
  ** components may contain `state`
  ** may contain JS for functionality
  ** must have `render()` method, typically `return ($HTML_JSX)` <= best to have single root element
  ** JSX uses attribute `className` in place of `class` because it is reserved keyword in JS
  ** `ReactDOM.render(<MyApp />, document.getElementById('app'));`
  ** JSX render js in string: `<p>{ Math.random() * 10 }</p>`
* CDN of react as core links: https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
  ** option for dev vs. production (minified) links
  ** browser render babel:
    *** `<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/bable.min.js></script>`
    *** `<script type="text/babel">...class MyApp extends React.component {...} ...</script>`
* VS Code Helper plugins
  ** ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL snippets
  ** Sublime Babel _syntax highlighting of JSX_
  ** LiveServer to open code in browser
* `src/redux/reducers/todos.js` heavily leverages ES6 deconstructor syntax `...XXX`
* wrap `<TodoApp />` with `<Provider />` API provided by React Redux
